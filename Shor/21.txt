Please input the integer:
21

A new round started.
Let x = 2
43/(2^7)=0.3359375
No r satifies a^r=1 mod N.

A new round started.
Let x = 4
Got s = 0. Try Again ...
Got s = 0. Try Again ...
86/(2^7)=0.671875
        = 2/3
r = 3, but r is odd.

A new round started.
Let x = 8
Got s = 0. Try Again ...
Got s = 0. Try Again ...
64/(2^7)=0.5
        = 1/2
r = 2, x^(r/2) = 8.
One factor f = 7
Final answer is 21 = 7 * 3
